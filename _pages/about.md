<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a master student at the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), supervied by [Cam-Tu Nguyen](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/CamTuNguyen/index.htm).

I obtained my B.E. degree in Automation (Major), and Computer Science and Technology (Minor) from  Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU) in 2021. 
In the same year, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree without entrance examination in Nanjing University.
Before that, I graduated from Linchuan No.1 Middle School, Jiangxi Province in 2017.

My research interests lie in natural language processing, especially in controllable text generation and question & answering. My ultimate goal is to narrow the interaction barrier between human and machine, with a controllable, efficient and humanism languge agent.
