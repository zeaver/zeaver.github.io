<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Currently, I serve as an AI Messenger Product Designer in Alibaba.com ([web](www.alibaba.com) \| [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alibaba.intl.android.apps.poseidon) \| [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/alibaba-com/id503451073)), one of the worldâ€™s leading B2B ecommerce marketplaces. At Alibaba.com, I am responsible for the development and maintenance of the fundamental messenger and some of the Smart Assistant, which bridge the cross-border wholesale transactions between the Chinese suppliers and overseas buyers.

Prior to joining Alibaba.com, I pursued my master's degree at the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), supervised by [Cam-Tu Nguyen](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/CamTuNguyen/index.htm).
In 2021, I graduated from Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU) with a Bachelor of Engineering in Automation as my major and a minor in Computer Science and Technology. In the same year, I was admitted to Nanjing University for a Master of Science degree without an entrance examination. 
Before that, I graduated from Linchuan No.1 Middle School in Jiangxi Province in 2017.

My research interests lie in natural language processing, especially in controllable text generation and question & answering. My ultimate goal is to narrow the interaction barrier between human and machine, with a controllable, efficient and humanism languge agent.
